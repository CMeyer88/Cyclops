# CYCLOPS
The UX/UI Pattern Guide for the CenturyLink Platform

## Get Started
Cyclops is hosted on the [CenturyLink Platform assets server](http://assets.ctl.io/) for anyone to use. Add `.cyclops` to the `html` tag to properly scope the styles. This allows Cyclops to override any existing styles that have been defined by legacy markup. See the [version documentation](http://assets.ctl.io/) for what includes are required.

## Developing Cyclops

```
npm install
gulp dev
```

#### [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
Much of this pattern library is based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). We've taken many foundational patterns from this project, and extended it to suit the needs of CenturyLink's Platform.
