        <small>h1 small text</small>
      </h1>
      <h2>H2 30pt Open Sans Light

    <h5>Content Headers</h5>
    <p>Add the
      <code>.content-header</code> to any html header entity, and it will automatically add a border below the header text.</p>
    <div class="pl-example">
      <h1 class="content-header">H1 36pt Open Sans Light
        <small>h1 small text</small>
      </h1>

    <p>Sometimes you'll want to treat multiple entities as the content header. Here's an example of that.</p>
    <div class="pl-example">
      <div class="content-header">
        <h1>QA1DEVLBTEST01</h1>
        <p class="lead">Load Balancer Test VM</p>

          <h4>This is a Paragraph Header</h4>
          <p>I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible
            coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start.</p>

          <p>I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more
            drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.</p>
