    <p class="lead">The Platform CenturyLink UX Pattern Library</p>

    <p>The pattern library is a collection of atomic pieces that make up the Platform CenturyLink Control Portal interface. By documenting and assembling a reference site of our patterns, we are able to speed up our development process, and address internal communication problems inherent with working on a distrubited team. A common lexicon of code and UI elements benefits us in a few ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We build consistently, allowing us to focus our energy on creating products and services, not web forms and list items.</li>
      <li>We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel.</li>
      <li>We can see all of our patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This Pattern Library isn’t meant to be a UI framework like <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> — although we do use bootstrap as our underlying page structure. It’s tailored specifically to our needs, so if you attempt to use it as a foundation for a future project your mileage may vary. It uses the same source css and javascript libraries that are available in the Control Portal itself.</p>

<p>The examples should be well documented with code comments, so view source if you're looking for code samples. You may also view the source of the pages directly. Tier3.Platform.Control.Web project > Views > UX> then look for the corresponding page. The JavaScript code for each section (if needed) will be located in a script block at the beginning of the section.</p>

<p>This is a living document — we will be adding and amending patterns as we see fit. If you have suggestions for additional patterns, or have questions about anything you see here, don't hesitate to ask in our slack channel, <a href="https://cl-cloud.slack.com/messages/design-team/">#design-team</a>.</p>
